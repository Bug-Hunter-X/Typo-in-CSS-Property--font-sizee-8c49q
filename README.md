# CSS Typographical Error: font-sizee

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed error in CSS: a simple typo in a property name.

The `bug.css` file contains a typo in the `font-size` property.  It's written as `font-sizee`, which is not a valid CSS property, causing the styles to not be applied.

The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected version, fixing the typo and applying the correct styling.
